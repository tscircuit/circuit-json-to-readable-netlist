/**
 * Ranks how good a word is for a net name. Usually uncommon words are better.
 * If a word isn't on this list, it's given a score of 1
 *
 * A phrase is scored by finding the highest scoring word that it contains, so
 * for example GPIO1 would score 1.1, but GPIO1_RX would score 1.15
 *
 * These unique port names are usually the best indicator of what the net is for
